# Steps to build and run :
if you have Android Studio, just clone it, open it in android studio, press on play button, it will run the app into your emulator, or your physical android device if connected to your pc. 
Or i will leave an apk file in this repo, you can install it in your android device, and check the app itself.

Lets talk about the app now, when you open it for the first time, you see only two buttons add and delete. click on add you will see few icons, click on any icons to add it to your activity, icon does related actions,
for example, if you choose google drive, and click on google drive icon from the activity it will take you to google drive, if you click on the delete button near the add button it will erase all the icons from your
current storage. Remember these icons are stored in app's internal storage, so, if you select any icons, it will remain there even if you close the app, untill you uninstall the app or clear the app data.
```bash
